 BLACKBOX BBR64-DANTE RECORDER
  Capture live multi-channel audio for Performance, Broadcast, Film & TV Sound applications
  64 channels in one rack unit
The JoeCo BLACKBOX BBR64-DANTE RECORDER is based on the award-winning, tried and tested BlackBox Recorder design. However, rather than being limited to recording 24 channels of audio, the BBR64-DANTE is designed to record and replay up to 64 channels of audio data from a Dante network using standard Broadcast WAV files.
Developed to solve the inherent problems of working with computer-based systems in a live performance environment,
the BlackBox Recorder provides engineers with a computer-free, high-quality solution for multi-channel live audio capture. The BlackBox BBR64-DANTE Recorder can capture up to 64 channels of audio at 44.1kHz and 48kHz directly to Broadcast WAV files on an external USB2 (FAT32 formatted) drive.
The recorder connects to any Dante-enabled network device from a range of console and converter manufacturers including Yamaha, MIDAS, DiGiCo and Focusrite to name but a few. Designed to support standard network components and switches, it can also record 8 channels of analogue (balanced line in) alongside 56 channels of Dante for capturing audience and ambience.
The BBR64-DANTE will lock to the incoming Dante audio stream, as well as locking to or generating word clock. The headphone output can monitor the internal mix or PFL individual/pairs of channels, which are also sent to the hi-resolution meters.
The recorder is designed to be supremely simple to use, requiring just a network connection, power and a USB2 drive before pressing the RECORD button. A full colour LCD screen and striking LED displays show all the information the recording engineer needs in order to know whatʼs happening. The recorder can also be remotely controlled and monitored via JoeCoRemote for iPad.
The BBR64-DANTE includes numerous safety features, inherited from the original BlackBox Recorder, to keep your recording as secure as possible. SafeʼnʼSound Record Recovery will recover files even if the power fails in the middle of a recording.
An additional software add-on turns the BBR64-DANTE Recorder into a BlackBox Player, enabling synchronous or instant playback of audio material for various applications.
